 gcovr CHANGELOG
=================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Under development.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.3.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Adding support for Python 3.x

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Adding the --gcov-filter and --gcov-exclude options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added a test driver for gcovr.

- Improved estimation of the <sources> element when using gcovr with filters.


- Added revision and date keywords to gcovr so it is easier to
  identify what version of the script users are using (especially
  when they are running a snapshot from trunk).

- Addressed special case mentioned in comment:ticket:3884:1: do not
  truncate the reported file name if the filter does not start
  matching at the beginning of the string.

- Overhaul of the --root / --filter logic. This should resolve the
  issue raised in #3884, along with the more general filter issue
  raised in comment:ticket:3884:1

- Overhaul of gcovr's logic for determining gcc/g++'s original
  working directory. This resolves issues introduced in the original
  implementation of --object-directory (resolves #3872) and fixes
  #3883.

- Bugfix: gcovr was only including a <sources> element in the XML
  report if the user specified -r (resolves #3869)

- Adding timestamp and version attributes to the gcovr XML report
  (as documented in #3877).  It looks like the standard Cobertura
  output reports number of seconds since the epoch for the timestamp
  and a doted decimal version string.  Now, gcovr reports seconds
  since the epoch and "gcovr "+__version__ (e.g. "gcovr 2.2") to
  differentiate it from a pure Cobertura report.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added the --object-directory option, which allows for a flexible
  specification of the directory that contains the objects generated
  by gcov.

- Adding fix to compare the absolute path of a filename to an exclusion
  pattern.

- Adding error checking when no coverage results are found. The line and
  branch counts can be zero.

- Adding logic to process the -o/.output option. (Resolves #3870)

- Adding patch to scan for lines that look like:
    creating `foo'
  as well as
    creating 'foo'

- Changing the semantics for EOL to be portable for MS Windows.

- Add attributes to xml format so that it could be used by hudson/bamboo with
  cobertura plug-in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Initial release as a separate package.  Earlier versions of gcovr were
  managed within the 'fast' Python package.
