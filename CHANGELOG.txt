= `gcovr` Release History and Change Log =


=== 2.4 ''(under development)'' ===
 - New approach to walking the directory tree that is more robust to
   symbolic links
 - Windows compatibility fixes
   - Fix for how we parse `source:` file names (#3913)
   - Better handling od EOL indicators (#3920)
 - Normalize all path names to full absolute path (#3921)
 - Fix so that gcovr cleans up all `.gcov` files, even those filtered by
   command line arguments
 - Added compatibility with GCC 4.8 (#3918)
 - Added a check to warn users who specify an empty `--root` option (see #3917)
 - Force `gcov` to run with en_US localization, so the gcovr parser runs
   correctly on systems with non-English locales.
 - Miscellaneous (Python 3.x) portability fixes
 - Added the master svn revision number as part of the verson identifier


=== 2.3.1 ''(6 January 2012)'' ===
 - Adding support for Python 3.x


=== 2.3 ''(11 December 2011)'' ===
 - Adding the --gcov-filter and --gcov-exclude options.


=== 2.2 ''(10 December 2011)'' ===
 - Added a test driver for gcovr.
 - Improved estimation of the <sources> element when using gcovr with filters.
 - Added revision and date keywords to gcovr so it is easier to identify
   what version of the script users are using (especially when they are
   running a snapshot from trunk).
 - Addressed special case mentioned in comment:ticket:3884:1: do not
   truncate the reported file name if the filter does not start matching
   at the beginning of the string.
 - Overhaul of the --root / --filter logic. This should resolve the
   issue raised in #3884, along with the more general filter issue
   raised in comment:ticket:3884:1
 - Overhaul of gcovr's logic for determining gcc/g++'s original working
   directory. This resolves issues introduced in the original
   implementation of --object-directory (resolves #3872) and fixes
   #3883.
 - Bugfix: gcovr was only including a <sources> element in the XML
   report if the user specified -r (resolves #3869)
 - Adding timestamp and version attributes to the gcovr XML report (as
   documented in #3877).  It looks like the standard Cobertura output
   reports number of seconds since the epoch for the timestamp and a
   doted decimal version string.  Now, gcovr reports seconds since the
   epoch and "gcovr "+__version__ (e.g. "gcovr 2.2") to differentiate it
   from a pure Cobertura report.


=== 2.1 ''(26 November 2010)'' ===
 - Added the --object-directory option, which allows for a flexible
   specification of the directory that contains the objects generated by
   gcov.
 - Adding fix to compare the absolute path of a filename to an exclusion
   pattern.
 - Adding error checking when no coverage results are found. The line and
   branch counts can be zero.
 - Adding logic to process the -o/.output option. (Resolves #3870)
 - Adding patch to scan for lines that look like:
   {{{
creating `foo'
}}}
   as well as
   {{{
creating 'foo'
}}}
 - Changing the semantics for EOL to be portable for MS Windows.
 - Add attributes to xml format so that it could be used by hudson/bamboo with
   cobertura plug-in.


=== 2.0 ''(22 August 2010)'' ===
 - Initial release as a separate package.  Earlier versions of gcovr
   were managed within the 'fast' Python package.
